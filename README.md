# tunnelr

The plan is for this to be a one-stop-shop for creating a reverse tunnel.

It should eventually:

* Setup keys (on both sides)
* Setup reverse ssh tunnel
* [maybe] offer a non-ssh client listener (that basically will just implement an ssh server)

It will create the `~/.tunnelr` directory and drop stuff there by default.  The formats of things in that dir may change.

## Usage

```bash
A tunnel digger

Usage:
  tunnelr [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  keys        Generates key pair for use with tunnelr
  rssh        Opens reverse ssh connection to an address

Flags:
  -h, --help     help for tunnelr
  -t, --toggle   Help message for toggle

Use "tunnelr [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### keys

Generate some ssh keys

```bash
Generates key pair for use with tunnelr

Usage:
  tunnelr keys [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for keys
  -n, --name string   name for the generated keys (without extension) (default "id_rsa")
```

### rssh

Heavily influenced by [andrew-d's rssh](https://github.com/andrew-d/rssh).  Probably made worse by wrapping things
the way I generally do them in Go[lang].  Integrated into tunnelr as a subcommand.

```bash
Opens reverse ssh connection to an address

Usage:
  tunnelr rssh [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --command string    local command to execute (default "/bin/sh")
  -h, --help              help for rssh
  -i, --identity string   ssh identity (key) file
      --insecure          ignore host key verification
  -l, --listen string     remote listen address and port (default "127.0.0.1:22345")
  -u, --username string   connect as given username
```
